# Aim: Hello World and Calculator program
# Software Required:
Visual Studio
# Theory:
•	The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.

•	The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.

•	The next line '// main() is where program execution begins.' is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.

•	The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.

•	The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.

•	The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.

## TOOls USED:
- #include <iostream>: Includes the input-output stream library for using cin and cout.
  
- using namespace std;: Allows access to the standard namespace, simplifying code syntax.

-  // (Single-line comment): Used to annotate code for clarity; ignored during execution.

- int main(): Entry point of the program where execution begins.

- cout << "Hello World";: Outputs the string to the console.

- return 0;: Ends the main() function and returns control to the operating system.
  
 ## Conclusion:

The Hello World program successfully demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program, including headers, namespaces, comments, and output statements. The calculator extension further reinforces understanding of input/output, arithmetic operations, and control flow. This foundational exercise builds confidence in writing and debugging simple C++ programs.
<ins>Standard Output Stream - cout</ins>:
The C++ cout is the instance of the iostream class used to produce output on the standard output device which is usually the display screen. The data needed to be displayed on the screen is inserted in the standard output stream (cout) using the insertion operator(<<).

<ins>Standard Input Stream - cin</ins>:
The C++ cin statement is the instance of the class istream and is used to read input from the standard input device which is usually a keyboard. The extraction operator (>>) is used along with the object cin for extracting the data from the input stream and store it in some variable in the program.

# Implementation:
The basics i.e input and output functions and basic arithmatic operators (more is discussed in the next part) of C++ are seen through the following programs,
+ Hello World(Printing Hello World)
+ Making a simple calculator

# Conclusion:
The basics of C++ was seen through the programs.
